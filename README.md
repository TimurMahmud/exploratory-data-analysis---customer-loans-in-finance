## Description
This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer loans within the finance domain. The aim of the project is to gain insights into the loan data, understand patterns, and prepare the data for further analysis. Through EDA, we aim to answer questions, uncover hidden trends, and extract valuable information from the loan dataset.

During the course of this project, we will use various data analysis techniques, visualizations, and statistical methods to explore the loan dataset. This EDA will help in identifying potential factors influencing loan outcomes, customer creditworthiness, and more.
